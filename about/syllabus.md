## Description du cours
Ce cours a pour but de retracer les origines et le développement de la pensée cartographique européenne et d’identifier comment l’imagination géographique va de pair avec l’ambition coloniale. Après une étude de la géographie des XIIe et XIIIe siècles, nous retraçons comment les idées de l’univers et les rapports entre l’être humain et l’espace subissent une profonde transformation d’où apparaît l’exploration européenne et la prise en possession des quatre coins du monde. Les premières lueurs du racisme institutionnel moderne s’avèrent étroitement liées à ces changements culturels et scientifiques et, en guise de conclusion, ce cours propose d’identifier les vestiges cachés de l'héritage médiéval qui côtoient notre conception moderne de l’espace et la subjectivité.

## Devoirs
Une description détaillée de chaque devoir sera disponible sur le site du cours. À suivre.

## Participation FSO
A principle objective of the French program at Washington and Lee University is to prepare you to communicate efficiently and interact critically with the francophone world. The FSO arranges extra-curricular cultural activities and events throughout the semester to maximize your exposure to the French language and to diverse perspectives from the francophone world. For these reasons, **all of our French classes from beginning to advanced** require students to attend at least three FSO or departmental events and one international event every semester, for a total of four extracurricular events. International or cultural events could be one organized by another department, by a cultural or other student organization on campus, which may include Spanish, or even a guest speaker presenting on a cultural topic. This is meant to broaden your range of cultural perspectives beyond those of the Francophone world.

Please note that because of covid, FSO activities this year are difficult to plan, especially since we do not have a WLTF in French. For this reason the required amount of activities will likely change. Our 2020-21 FSO officers (Evan Berman, Andrew Martinelli, Sharon Mendieta Ramirez, and Christian Null) have stepped in to make these events happen, and we are grateful for their contributions.
